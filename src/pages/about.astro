			<p>
				Hello, I'm 
				<strong class="font-semibold text-dark-text">André</strong>, 
				a multifaceted <strong class="font-semibold text-dark-text">front-end developer</strong> and designer. 
				My tech odyssey began as a kid in the 90s with a Commodore 64, my first love in computing – where 
				I was more likely to be found trying to outsmart 8-bit challenges than doing my homework. 
				This whimsical start led to over two decades immersed in 
				<strong class="font-semibold text-dark-text">graphic design</strong> 
				and <strong class="font-semibold text-dark-text">web development</strong>. 
				I've had the privilege of working with a wide array of clients and have thrived in diverse settings, 
				both as a collaborative team member and as an independent freelancer.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				Currently, I am working at 
				<a href="https://talentadore.com" target="_blank">Talentadore</a>
				as a front-end developer, where I continue to apply and enhance my skills in this dynamic field.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				My professional toolkit is extensive, with proficiencies in the Adobe Creative Suite, Figma,
				and modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, React, and more.
				I am committed to creating seamless designs and user-centric development. Recently, I've
				been expanding my skills in 3D modeling with Blender and delving into web graphics through
				Three.js, showcasing my passion for learning and growth in the field.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				As a <strong class="font-semibold text-dark-text">technology enthusiast</strong>, 
				I am always intrigued by the latest trends and innovations. My interests span across VR, gadgets, 
				home automation, and virtually everything tech-related. This enthusiasm for technology is a driving 
				force in my personal and professional life, pushing me to explore and experiment with new ideas 
				and tools.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				In my free time, I'm dedicated to activities that challenge me both mentally and physically.
				I enjoy learning chess, playing the piano, and engaging in sports like badminton, biking,
				and table tennis. Additionally, I'm a big fan of Rocket League, which combines my love for
				fast-paced gaming and teamwork. These activities not only provide a healthy balance but also
				contribute to my creative and analytical thinking.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				My blog is a reflection of my diverse interests and projects in the tech world, covering a
				range of topics and explorations. It's where I share my insights, learnings, and experiences
				with a wider audience.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				If you're looking for a developer with a unique blend of creativity, technical expertise,
				and a passion for the latest in technology, let's connect. I'm eager to bring my diverse
				skills and perspectives to your next project.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				Best regards,<br /><br />
